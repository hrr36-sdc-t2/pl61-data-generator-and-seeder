# pl61-data-generator-and-seeder
Generates fake data for seeding into MongoDB or MySQL instances, 10 million primary records with ~90 million secondary records.

MongoDB
  - data generation and insertion time (2 workers): 100-120 min
  - query time (1 record from 10 million primary): ~30 ms

MySQL
  - data generation and insertion time (4 workers): ~25-30 min
  - query time (5-11 records from 90 million secondary): ~50 ms

## Usage

seed-mysql <items per worker (4 workers)> <batch insert size>

query-mongo <column> <value>
query-mysql <column> <value>
```
Seed scripts accept optional arguments. Default settings insert a total of 10 million primary records and ~90 million secondary records in batch sizes of 1000.

Query script accept optional arguments. Default uses a predetermined query. For MongoDB, query is on primary records. For MySQL, query is on secondary records.

Respective databases are created if do not exist when seed scripts are run.

## Requirements

  - Node 11.6.0
  - MongoDB 4.0
  - MySQL 8.0

## Development

All data inserted directly from memory in batches without writing to file. Fake strings generated by faker.lorem.sentence.
